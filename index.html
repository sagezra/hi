    <h3><a name="#a">ART</a></h3>
      <p>My artwork focuses around creative interpretation of pre-existing images or landscapes. In my photography, I try to capture things as mementos that will help me remember what was occuring in that moment.</p><br>

    <h3><a name="#g">GOALS</a></h3>
    
      <p>This section goes over career-oriented and artistic goals.</p><br> 
      </center>    
      <li>I would like to work in politics to help consituents understand and be included in the process of policymaking.</li>
      <li>I am open to working most political jobs apart from canvassing, due to work-place trauma from customer interactions. I want to do legislative services, campaign finance work, campaign data entry, political consulting, and political lobbying work.</li>
      <li>I want to learn how to develop and manipulate 53mm film.</li>
      <li>I want to get back into ceramics and try different firing processes.</li>
      <li>I want to move out of Richmond, VA and into a larger, more diverse city that has an interesting art scene.</li>
